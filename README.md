# Takehome Coding Challenge
Coding challenge where I built a Raffle App client that interacts with a RESTful API using Swift (Mobile). The Raffle API was created by the staff from my coding program for this particular project. I built this app over Memorial Day weekend. It was a fun exercise and working on improvements. I plan to replace the back-end with my own next. 

See details of the project [here](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Frontend-And-Mobile-Takehome-Coding-Challenge).

Create a client for a Raffle application. Users are able to:

* [X] Create raffles
* [X] List all raffles
* [X] Add participants users to raffles
* [X] Draw a winner from a raffle, etc.
